              <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
                environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                programmatic control over them.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
                Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such
                as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
              </p>
            </div>
            <ul class="infor">
              <li class="infor-items">
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application
                to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
                such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </li>
              <li class="infor-items">
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with
                a database, provide continuity of information from one
                invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.

            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                avaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java
                but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming
                conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
                small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
                string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
                instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is,
                what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
                also supports functions without any special declarative
                requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing
                as loosely typed methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do
                not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do
                not have to be concerned with whether methods are public,
                private, or protected, and you do not have to implement
                interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are
                not explicitly typed.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and

            <p>
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your
              application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
              to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
              or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits
              (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
              characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
              through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
              identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
              characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
              Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
            </p>

              <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
              <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>

            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global
                variables.
              </p>
              <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            </div>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
                JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
              </p>
              <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            </div>
            <code>let y = 13.</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
                See Variable scope below.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is
                called a global variable, because it is available to any other
                code in the current document. When you declare a variable within
                a function, it is called a local variable, because it is
                available only within that function.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
                scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to
                the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.
                For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of
                x is the function (or global context) within which x is
                declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced
                in ECMAScript 2015.
              </p>
            </div>
            <code
              >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
              not defined</code
            >
          </div>

          <div class="global" id="globall">
            <div class="title">
              <h2>Global variables</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In
                web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access
                global variables using the window.variable syntax.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one
                window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the
                window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
                phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
                variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
              </p>

            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const
                keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for
                a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore
                or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or
                underscore characters.
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
                re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
                initialized to a value.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let
                block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the
                identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
              </p>
              <p>
                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function
                or variable in the same scope. For example:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code
              >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
              WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
              //statements }</code
            >
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following

                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they
                enable you to perform useful functions with your applications.
                Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the
                language. You can think of objects as named containers for
                values, and functions as procedures that your application can
                perform.

                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical
                condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a
                statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as
                follows:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false.
                See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and
                false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed;
                otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2
                can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have
                multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code
              >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
              statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
              statement_last; }</code
            >
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical
                condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute
                multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ...
                }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block
                statements, especially when nesting if statements:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code
              >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
              statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
              statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
              statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code

            <div class="desc">

                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
                expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality
                when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the
                following code:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a
                common practice is to put additional parentheses around the
                assignment. For example:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
          </div>

          <div class="while" id="while_statement">
            <div class="title">
              <h2>while statement</h2>

                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
                condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>while (condition) statement</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
                executing and control passes to the statement following the
                loop.
              </p>
              <p>
                The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is
                executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed
                and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns
                false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement
                following while.
              </p>
              <p>
                To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... })
                to group those statements.
              </p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p>
                The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than
                three:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value
                to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
              </p>
            </div>
            <ul class="infor">
              <li class="infor-items">fter the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
              <li class="infor-items">
                After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
              </li>
              <li class="infor-items">After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no
                longer true, so the loop terminates.
              </p>
            </div>

                For example, the following code defines a simple function named
                square:
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                The function square takes one argument, called number. The
                function consists of one statement that says to return the
                argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself.
                The return statement specifies the value returned by the
                function.
              </p>
            </div>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions
                by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the
                function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not
                reflected globally or in the calling function.
